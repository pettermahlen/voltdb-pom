This project contains two pom files intended to be used when deploying or installing VoltDB into Maven repositories. Note that the 
files do NOT provide any support for building VoltDB; you'll need to do that using methods supplied by VoltDB themselves, or get
binary distributions for them.

To install into your local repository, do:

mvn install:install-file
